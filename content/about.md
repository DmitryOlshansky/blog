My name is Dmitry Olshansky and I'm a computer science researcher with broad spectrum of interests. Over time my focus changed from Robotics to AI to Compilers and Runtimes to Distributed Systems. 

## Philosophy

* The world is too simple to believe it.

* Two good brains is all it takes.

* We become what we do.	(Pierre Gauthier)
